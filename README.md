## Machine-Learning-Regression

Before going for the regression problem, it is good to understand the data, i.e., whether our sample data represents the gaussian curve or not. If it doesn't follow the gaussian curve, we have to normalize the data using the data normalization method. We have 5 different methods to normalize the data, but we have to check which method fits our data because there is no straightforward method that applies to all kinds of data. That's why we must check all those methods one by one and check which method fits well for our data.
This repository consists of all the data normalization methods in the data_normailzation.ipynb file.
i.   log transform
ii. reciprocal transform
iii. exponential transform
iv. box-cox transform
v.   yeo-johnson transform

This repository consists of two types of regression method
1. Support Vector Machines
2. Random Forest
